# 🧪 Testing Employment Trend Forecasting UI

## 🚀 Quick Test Guide

### **Step 1: Start the Python Service**
```bash
cd backend/python_services
python forecasting_api.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🚀 Starting Employment Trend Forecasting API...
📊 Testing database connection...
✅ Database connected successfully
🌐 Starting Flask server on http://localhost:5001
```

### **Step 2: Test the API Directly**
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:5001/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "Employment Trend Forecasting API",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "database_connected": true
}
```

### **Step 3: Test from Node.js Backend**
```bash
# In another terminal, from backend directory
curl http://localhost:3000/api/forecasting/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "Python ML Forecasting",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### **Step 4: Test the UI**

1. **Login** to your application (as applicant or employer)
2. **Navigate** to "Market Insights" in the sidebar
3. **Check the tabs** - you should now see:
   - ✅ **Overview** tab (with real data cards)
   - ✅ **Skills** tab (with hot skills and trends)
   - ✅ **Trends** tab (with category analysis)

## 🎯 What You Should See

### **Overview Tab:**
- **4 colored cards** showing:
  - Total Categories: [number]
  - Growing Categories: [number]
  - Hot Skills: [number]
  - Analysis Period: "Last 90 days"

- **Growing Categories section** with:
  - Category names (e.g., "Technology", "Healthcare")
  - Growth rates (e.g., "+15.3%", "+12.7%")
  - Total job counts

### **Skills Tab:**
- **Hot Skills in Demand** with:
  - Skill names (e.g., "Python", "React")
  - Mention counts (e.g., "45 mentions")
  - Skill categories

- **Skill Trend Analysis** with:
  - Trend directions (↗️ increasing, → stable)
  - Total demand numbers

### **Trends Tab:**
- **Category cards** showing:
  - Category names with trend indicators (📈📉)
  - Total jobs in each category
  - Growth rates (+/-%)
  - Recent activity (jobs/day)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: "Forecasting service unavailable"**
**Solution:**
1. Check Python service is running: `python forecasting_api.py`
2. Verify port 5001 is not blocked
3. Check database connection in `.env` file

### **Issue: "No data available"**
**Solution:**
1. Ensure you have job postings in your database
2. Check if jobs have categories assigned
3. Verify skills are linked to job requirements
4. Run: `npm run forecast-trends` to generate data

### **Issue: Tabs not working**
**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify React components are properly imported

### **Issue: Static content still showing**
**Solution:**
1. The MarketAnalytics component has been updated
2. Refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check if the new component is being used
